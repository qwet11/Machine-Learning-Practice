# Machine-Learning-Practice

In this repository, I explored various Data Science models and projects.

> Many of the templates and files are taken from Tutorials Point. I explicitly say which files are mine and which are from Tutorials Point in each folder's README. 

This repository will keep growing as I explore more data science topics in my free time. If you have any suggestions or recommendations, feel free to let me know.
